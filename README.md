# RESTful API - Airbnb Clone - Web Application

![Airbnb Clone](https://your_image_url_here.png)

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on developing a RESTful API for an Airbnb clone web application. The API allows users to interact with different resources, such as User, Place, State, City, Review, and Amenity.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What REST means
- What API means
- What CORS means
- What is an API
- What is a REST API
- What are other types of APIs
- Which is the HTTP method to retrieve resources
- Which is the HTTP method to create a resource
- Which is the HTTP method to update a resource
- Which is the HTTP method to delete a resource
- How to request a REST API

### Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked with coming up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives mentioned above. You will not be able to meet these objectives by copying and pasting someone else's work. Remember that any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- You have to use the `unittest` module
- All your test files should be Python files (with the extension `.py`)
- All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Your file organization in the `tests` folder should be the same as your project (e.g., for `models/base_model.py`, unit tests must be in `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`)
- All your tests should be executed using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- You can also test file by file using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
- Collaboration on test cases is strongly encouraged to ensure that no edge cases are missed.
